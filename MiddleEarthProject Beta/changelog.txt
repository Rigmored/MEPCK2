- Aragorn will now change his name and his dynasty to Elessar Telcontar instead of Aragorn Isildurionath after his crown.

	*Added event chain to get the ring by more dynamic means :
-Chances (and cost) of getting it will depend on holder's rank. Getting it from an emperor will cost 5000 gold and be almost impossible.
-Getting it from an unlanded courtier will cost 1000 gold, and have much higher chance of success
-The best method therefore is to defeat the emperor who has the ring and hope his heirs scatter to some insignificant court with the ring
-Beware of taking the ring if Sauron is still alive! Life expectancies drop drastically for known ringbearers who have his ring and are not in constant hiding.
-You need at least 1000 wealth before the decision will show up
	
	*Added Kinstrife event to Gondor : 
-If the heir is not of numenorean blood or half-elven/elven blood then the King will be warned his vassals may not accept him or her
-If that heir takes the throne, the vassals with the blood of numenor will attempt to find another heir of isildur who has the blood of numenor (either version)
-If that fails, a Gondorian prince with the trait will try to take the throne himself
-This starts a new kinstrife war all over gondor

- Moved Black Numenoreans, Southron, and Easterling religions to their own separate religion group, so that they can now raid the other "religions" of men. This should stop the Black Numenoreans from constantly raiding Lindon

- In the same way, some new bonuses possible : you'll be able to gain new characters in your court, or to gain a new nickname.
- Colonizations will be able only once in two years.
- Vassals will be able to colonize now.

CLAIMS : 
- Dwarves will now have a claim on Moria if Sauron is defeated, and a claim on Gundbad if the Moria is reconquered.
- Every 5 years or so after 11375, Sauron gets a claim on a random bordering duchy from the "good side" cultures, to encourage mordorian expansion
- added a few events for non halfling/non-maiar ringbearers, still WIP
- added a few events for galadriel when she has ring, still WIP
- High King of hte Noldor event for Elrond if he has K_Eregion and other conditions, and also choice to re-build Eregion for his sons if Sauron is defeated

- Added two new titular kingdoms for historical flavour : Nogrod and Belegost.
- Added new nickname for Durin I : the Deathless
- Added new random dynasties names for Dunedain culture.

GAMEPLAY :
- General changes to racial traits, no longer inherit_chance = 100, they are given via events to those who should have them already. It should no longer be possible to get health of 100+ from marrying those with creature of melkor traits.
- Also made event that if an evil AI ruler marries an orc, he kills her once he sees her. Evil human-played rulers, however, have the option to say they rather like her and keep her.
- This should further make half-orcs very rare. Evil rulers also spawn some evil female courtiers of cult of melkor, so that they don't have to go lookign for orc brides.
- The only half-orcs (if you want to get that trait for your heirs) are now spawned in Saruman's court shortly after start-up
- Tweaked (drastically lowered in most cases) health bonuses for racial traits
- Tweaked (drastically lowered) opinion bonuses from most items 
- Increase ai_ambition for those corrupted by darkness, hopefully leading to more wars from Mordor
- Uruk Hai now also get the creature of melkor trait
- Sauron now really DOES lose the ringbearer trait when he get the ring. Alllmost sure it's fixed properly now!
*Tweaked health_events again
- Humans get the vanilla infirm-to-incapable health events
- Those with high blood of numenor get it later in life, and those with lower blood of numenor a bit earlier, but still after 100. Let us know how long people live on 
average in your games, those with health added health bonuses such as blood of isildur or elven blood on top of their numenor trait should be able to live to 200ish (if they're lucky)
- Dwarves also begin to get infirm at around 300ish years of age, but can live to 400ish if they're healthy
- Half-Elves, if anyone ever gets one, live to be 150-250ish (Yes, I know Elros lived 450ish, but this is the later 3rd age, and you're just the descendant of a silvan elf, not a royal line
with maiar blood)
- Sauron can build a 75-man Olog Hai elite retinue, they're x5 for combat purposes. Hopefully AI will use them against Dunedain doomstacks in late-game.
- Gave Barad-Dur special building more income; half the reason Sauron is inactive, I suspect, is because he is constantly broke and broke rulers can't declare war
- Gave Sauron an event to max out city and feudal taxes if they are not already; a human player can say no, of course, and won't get it again if so
- In defines.lua, changed BASE_AI_ARMY_SIZE = 40000, (it was 10,000 before). This should mean orcs should horde better together, and hopefully give an edge against the lower troop numbers of the good side
- Also reduced LEVY_MAINTENANCE_FACTOR = 1.5 to LEVY_MAINTENANCE_FACTOR = 0.75, it was only hurting Sauron who kept getting -40 income per day when he raised his hordes and spent most of the game in bankruptcy and inactive
- Nerfed halfling income buildings
*War scores
- Sometimes the war for gondor was lost as Sauron took some provinces, but the gondorian army was not defeated in the field. Changed to this in defines.lua
    SETTLEMENT_WARSCORE_MULTIPLIER = 0.1,            
    VASSAL_SETTLEMENT_WARSCORE_MULTIPLIER = 0.1,
So occupied provinces now count for only 1/3rd as they did previously. Wars now depend more on the battles won and armies defeated, not occupied land (though occupied capitals still give same warscore as before)
Increased warscore for battles by 33% to make up for this
- religious conversion of vassals now requries 10,000 piety (to prevent AI spamming it, because the event is disabled)
- Slightly increased health bonus from blood of numenors, even the ones with the strong trait could die at 80 (they should die at 120ish now, hopefully, or earlier if they get sick of course)
- Sometimes elves die of "natural reasons", health file issue? In any case, gave them 50 health bonus now, they shouldn't die
- New event to encourage Arnor and Gondor to be split into two realms if the king has an available heir to take either one; there will be opinion penalties from vassals if you do not do this due to the difficulty of administering 
two such large and distant realms at once. It triggers from 11400 onwards.
- Anyone with learning less than 20 who is not a hobbit or maiar will now begin to be corrupted by the ring over a period of time

MAP:
-Changed terrain of certain provinces to Forest (Mirkwood etc)
